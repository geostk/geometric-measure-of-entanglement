# geometric-measure-of-entanglement
This depository use tensor decomposition to calculate the geometric measure of entanglement.

These code are the examples compared in paper

which test the effectiveness of applying tensor decomposition theory to calculate the geometric measure of entanglement.


The codes are written in Matlab with depends on the Matlab tensor toolbox developed by Kolda etc. A link of this pacakge can be found at
